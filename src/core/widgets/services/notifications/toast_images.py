"""Toast images, read from the Windows notification database.

The listener hands out only the text elements of a toast, so the images a notification
carries cannot be reached through it. Windows itself keeps the raw toast XML in a SQLite
database of its own, and the images it draws are local files referenced from that payload.
This module reads the payload and turns those references into file paths. A source Windows
had to fetch over the network is looked up in the record it keeps of its own downloads, so
nothing here goes to the network either. It never decodes an image: that is the GUI thread's
job, the same way app icons are already handled.

A picture is copied aside the first time it is seen, because the file the payload points at
usually does not last as long as the notification does.
